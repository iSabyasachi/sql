answers for codebasics.io sql course exercise questions,

1) select all hollowood movies released after year 2000 that made more than 500 millions $ 
profit or more profit. Note that all hollywood movies have millions as a unit hence you don't
need to do unit converstion. Also you can write this query without CTE as well but you should
try to write this using CTE only

	with cte as (select title, release_year, (revenue-budget) as profit
			from movies m
			join financials f
			on m.movie_id=f.movie_id
			where release_year>2000 and industry="hollywood"
	)
	select * from cte where profit>500
